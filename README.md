# 3D OpenGL Maze Project

An interactive 3D maze experience built with OpenGL, featuring textured environments, dynamic shading, and real-time controls. Users can explore the maze in a first-person view, rotate the floating island that contains the maze, and manipulate the position of the sun to observe how lighting and shadows change across the scene.

### Features
- **Textured 3D Maze**: Detailed surfaces using RAW texture mapping.
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Includes ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting with shader-based rendering.
- **Sun Control**: Rotate the light source around the island to simulate day/night effects.
- **Island Rotation**: Spin the maze platform for alternative viewing angles.
- **First-Person Navigation**: Enter the maze and move through it from a first-person perspective.
- **Shader-Based Rendering**: Real-time shading and transformations via GLSL.
